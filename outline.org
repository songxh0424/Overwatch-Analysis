** compare some game stats between players in different levels: /Melee/ could be an interesting stat
** compare the performance of (win rate, elims) different heroes across all levels
** see how well support mains play dps
** see how well dps mains play support
** hero usage overall, low sr, high sr
** does meta exists? i.e., do meta heroes win more often than others at high sr
